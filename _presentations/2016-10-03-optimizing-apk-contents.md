title: Optimizing APK Contents
---

Most developers know of a few individual ways to make APKs smaller. For example, using ProGuard to remove dead code, stripping unused resources, or maybe switching to vector drawables to eliminate PNGs. Creating an optimal APK is not only about these tools and others, but also knowing how Android is going to use what's inside.

This talk will be a look at more advanced uses of the common tools for creating smaller APKs and some new ones which you might not have known existed. We'll also look at how smaller isn't actually always better when it comes to some parts of your APK.
