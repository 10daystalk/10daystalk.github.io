title: It's a Kotlin, Kotlin, Kotlin World
---

Kotlin's popularity has exploded in the past year and Google's announcement of first-party support at I/O means it's only going to keep increasing. Now is the perfect time to jump on the language as its future in mobile and beyond is very bright.

This talk start with a short introduction to the language syntax and features and their benefits. We'll then cover its use in building Android apps, writing Gradle build scripts, and using in IDE/Gradle plugins. Finally we'll take a look at where the language is headed and see if it can deliver on a promise of cross-platform use.
