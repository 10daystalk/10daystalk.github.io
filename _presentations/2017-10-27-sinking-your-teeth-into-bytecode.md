title: Sinking Your Teeth Into Bytecode
---

Bytecode is the first compilation output towards running code on the JVM or Android. This talk will be an exploration of how to read bytecode, understand what it's doing, and make informed decisions as a result. We'll compare and contrast examples in Java and Kotlin from the bytecode level to see how they work and their respective costs.
